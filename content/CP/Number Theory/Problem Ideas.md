# Problem Ideas

1. Let's say we have two numbers $A$ and $B$ such that $A + B = constant$. Then to minimize value of $A * B$ we need to increase the greater number as much as possible. For example say $B \geq A$, then we must try to further increase $B$ and decrease $A$ to make $A * B$ smaller.

       Lets say we increase B by x, then A decreases by x, this makes the product = (A - x) * (B + x) = AB - x(B - A) - x*x. Clearly this value is less than A * B.
