# Problem Ideas

1. Let's say we have two numbers $A$ and $B$ such that $A + B = constant$. Then to minimize value of $A * B$ we need to increase the greater number as much as possible. For example say $B \geq A$, then we must try to further increase $B$ and decrease $A$ to make $A * B$ smaller. **Proof**   Lets say we increase $B$ by $x$, then $A$ decreases by $x$, this makes the product $= (A - x) \times (B + x) = AB - x\times(B - A) - x^2$. Clearly this value is less than $A\times B$.
